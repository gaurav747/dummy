    description: `<p>A People's Calendar (aPC) is an open source project (started by myself in 2020) that seeks to promote the worldwide history of working class movements and liberation struggles in the form of a searchable "On This Day" calendar. This history includes, but is not limited to, indigenous resistance against colonization, the black liberation struggle, unionization efforts, slave rebellions, the women's suffrage movement, and workers' revolution.<br/><br/>The inspiration to make the calendar came from historian Howard Zinn's book "A People's History of the United States". Zinn's scholarship and political activism demonstrates that, if we are to understand what is how to approach our own societal issues today, we have to begin with a lucid understanding of our history.<br/><br/>This project exists as a <a href='http://www.apeoplescalendar.org' target='_blank' class='description-link'>web application</a>(made with ReactJS) and as an<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aPeoplesCalendar.aPC' target='_blank' class='description-link'>app on the Play Store</a>(React Native).</p>`,

    description: `<p>As a music educator, I was often frustrated with the online tools available for teaching the skill of recognizng chord progressions by ear. I decided to design my own, allowing the user all of the fine degree of control I wished that I had for my own students.<br/><br/>This app allows the user to loop chord playback, enable/disable any chord in a given key, toggle chord inversions, seventh chords, and randomized key centers, generate chord progressions from modes, and quiz on realistic examples from multiple genres.<br/><br/>You can get the<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps_by_trevor.comprehensive_chord_progression_ear_trainer' target='_blank' class='description-link'>Android app</a>(made with React Native) or check out the<a href='http://www.comprehensivechordtrainer.com' target='_blank' class='description-link'>web version</a>(ReactJS).</p>`,

    description: "<p>As a freelancer, I noticed how difficult it was for me to track my income - the total amount, the average over a period of time, seeing how much I made from each income source, etc. Failing to find an easily available application that fit my specific needs, I decided to use my knowledge of Python and its data-handling libraries to build what I needed for myself.</p><p>This program accepts a bank statement formatted as a .csv file and allows the user to view various data gleaned from their finances - average monthly income/expenditure/savings, instant and monthly bank account balance over time, projected savings, and, most importantly for freelancers like myself, the total amount of yearly income from each unique source in their account history.</p><p>This data is stored in a local database (via sqlite) for easy, recurrent access. I used the PyQt5 framework to produce a desktop graphic user interface.</p>",
