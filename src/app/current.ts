    title: `A People's Calendar`,
    description: `<p>A People's Calendar (aPC) is an open source project that seeks to promote the worldwide history of working class movements and liberation struggles in the form of a searchable "On This Day" calendar. This history includes, but is not limited to, indigenous resistance against colonization, the black liberation struggle, unionization efforts, slave rebellions, the women's suffrage movement, and workers' revolution.<br/><br/>The inspiration to make the calendar came from historian Howard Zinn's book "A People's History of the United States". Zinn's scholarship and political activism demonstrates that, if we are to understand how best to approach our own societal problems today, we have to begin with a lucid understanding of the issues of our past. It is my hope that such a catalog of events makes this complex and often overwhelming history easier to approach.<br/><br/>Get the <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aPeoplesCalendar.aPC' class='description-link'>app</a> or visit us on our website - <a href='https://www.apeoplescalendar.org' class='description-link'>apeoplescalendar.org</a>.</p>`
