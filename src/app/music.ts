    `One of my goals during the COVID-19 epidemic of 2020 (suddenly having more practice time on my hands) was to come out of it having developed a richer harmonic vocabulary
    for comping over two five one chord progressions, especially using polychords and quartal harmony in the style of pianists like McCoy Tyner and Benny Green.
    To make this easier, I compiled a list my favorite 2-5-1 voicings into a single pdf.`,
    `I'm sharing it here as an educational resource - one that I hope makes it easier for
    other jazz players and composers to find ways to get away from the typical triadic voicings in their comping and arranging.`

    `"Morgan’s Song" was originally composed as a chamber work by my grandfather, Dr. Charles W. Smith. It is dedicated to his
  granddaughter, my sister, Morgan Smith, whose birth coincided closely with the music’s genesis. The composition has become one of his most performed pieces, and
  it seems that the work of arranging it for new ensembles has fallen to me, now that my grandfather has passed away. Dr. Janet Bass Smith (my grandmother - quite
  the family affair) commissioned this arrangement for wind band, and I have added my own voice to the original work. The music begins in my grandfather’s consonant,
  pastoral manner but, as the piece progresses, becomes increasingly dissonant and complex in a style more akin to my own.`
  ,
  `For me, this gradual change is a kind of musical metaphor for how the baton of one musical generation gets passed on to the next. Although we are unique
  individuals, we are indelibly shaped by who came before us, not just as artists, but in totality as human beings. I will always be grateful for the influence
  and paths made possible for me (musical and otherwise) by my grandparents, and others who have come before me.`]

    `Dr. Smith approached me about writing a second work for her in late 2018. Again drawing from her evocative oil paintings, I chose her depiction of Colter's Hell
    (shown left), a series of hot springs and geysers that lie along the mouth of the Shoshone River's canyon, as inspiration for the music. The painting depicts an
    eruption from one of those geysers.`
    ,
    `The opening gesture of Colter’s Hell mirrors that moment; it is an eruption, an explosion of sound that starts low to the ground and ascends into a dissipating
    mist, high up into the air. The music explores these natural associations, translated into musical tones, in two movements - “Eruption” and “Sleeping River”.`

    `For flute and piano. Duration 10 minutes.`

    `The word \"ekmousiké\" is personal adaptation the poetic term \"ekphrasis\", which is used to refer to a vivid rhetorical description of a scene or, more
    commonly, a work of art. The word has Greek roots; \"ek\" is a prefix meaning \"out\" or \"of\", and \"phrasis\", which translates as \"to speak\". In other words,
    an \"ekphrastic poem\" is a prose approximation of a work of art. I wanted to achieve the same effect but with music, so instead of \"phrasis\", I substituted the
    Greek word for music, \"mousiké\" (pronounced moo-zee-kay).`,
    `Dedicated to my grandmother, Dr. Janet Smith, each movement is based off of one of her paintings or poems, and is intended to be a \"vivid musical description\"
    in the same way an ekphrastic poem would be. In order:`,
    `I. Sunset on Barren River Lake (painting, pictured top left)`,
    `II. Alone in Mammoth Cave (poem)`,
    `III. The Color of Death`,
    `IV. Winter Peace (painting)`,
    `V. Trifid Nebula (painting, pictured bottom left)`,
    `This work was completed to fulfill my thesis requirement for a Master's Degree in Music Composition. For solo piano. Duration 45 minutes.`

    `My first album of composed music.`,
    `While in graduate school, I began experimenting with electrifying acoustic instrument sounds (particularly saxophone) with guitar pedals and midi controllers, and I began to compose music by overlaying recordings of myself on top of each other.`,
    `The result was this album, in which each work was composed and performed entirely by myself, blending acoustically and electronically generated sounds to capture moments and moods from my own life (thus the title \"Isolation Chamber\"). The works range in tone from meditative ambience to breakbeat tone poems about broken bill accepting machines.`
